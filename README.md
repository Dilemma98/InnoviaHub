# InnoviaHub

InnoviaHub is a full-stack web application, built to streamline booking office resources and user managment.
Built with a React frontend and a .NET 9.0 backend, it offers secure authentication, JWT-based sessions, and API endpoints for managing users and various resources.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- **[.NET SDK 9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)**

- **ENV-variables**  
  In the root of your backend folder, create a new file and name it `.env`.  
  Also, make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore`.

#### JWT_SECRET

1. Generate a JWT secret key.

   - **Linux / macOS**  
     Open your terminal and run:  
     ```bash
     openssl rand -hex 32
     ```

   - **Windows (PowerShell)**  
     Open PowerShell and run:  
     ```powershell
     [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("N")
     ```

2. This will generate a random key. Place it in your `.env` file like this:

JWT_SECRET = "your_generated_jwt_token"

#### OPEN_AI_KEY
1. Go to [OpenAI’s API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
(You need an OpenAI account to access this page.)

2. Click on **“Create new secret key”** and copy the generated key.  
   > ⚠️ You will only see the key once — make sure to copy and save it securely.

3. Place the key in your `.env` file like this:

OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_generated_openai_api_key"
 > ⚠️ Never commit your API key to version control. Keep it safe and only share it via environment variables or secret managers.
